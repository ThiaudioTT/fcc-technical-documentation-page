                <p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist
                    Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language
                    has
                    expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional
                    features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always
                    implemented as
                    a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation,
                    LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.</p>
                <p>
                    C++ was designed with an orientation toward systems programming and embedded, resource-constrained
                    software and large systems, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design
                    highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software
                    infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, video games,
                    servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search, or databases), and performance-critical applications (e.g.
                    telephone switches or space probes)
                </p>
                <p>
                    C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest
                    standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2020 as ISO/IEC 14882:2020 (informally
                    known
                    as C++20). The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998,
                    which was then amended by the C++03, C++11, C++14, and C++17 standards. The current C++20 standard
                    supersedes these with new features and an enlarged standard library. Before the initial
                    standardization
                    in 1998, C++ was developed by Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an extension of the C language;
                    he
                    wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C that also provided high-level features for
                    program organization. Since 2012, C++ has been on a three-year release schedule with C++23 as
                    the next planned standard.

            <article>
                <p>The most important difference between the two languages is the different approach to programming that
                    each uses. <b>C is a procedural oriented language</b> and its emphasis is on functions.
                    Programs are divided into a set of functions and they consist of step-by-step instructions, or
                    commands,
                    to be executed in sequential order. This style of programming specifies how to do something, giving
                    structured steps for how computational
                    tasks will be carried out, following a top-down approach. This style of programming can get quite
                    messy
                    and error-prone when programs grow in size. It leads to a
                    lot of copying and pasting througout the file and updating many functions when there is a change.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Besides being a procedural language, <b>C++ is also an Object Oriented Programming language</b>,
                    which
                    is based
                    on the concept of diving a program into objects. Everything is organized and divided into smaller
                    groups
                    of related parts or objects, which are an
                    instance of a class, following a bottom-up approach. Object Oriented Programming is based on four
                    principles: encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance and
                    polymorhism. This style of programming creates more readable and usable code that is easier to
                    maintain,
                    while also
                    providing better data security.</p>

        <section id="Requisites" class="main-section">
            <header>Requisites</header>
            <p>For start a good C++ program, you will need at least these requirements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A compiler</li>
                <li>An IDE or a text editor</li>
                <li>Interest in learning</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Did you get it? Let's go!</p>
        </section>


        <section id="Hello_World" class="main-section">
            <header>Hello World</header>
            <p>Hello World is a good method to see the syntax of a language</p>
            <code>#include &ltiostream&gt
                 int main() {
                        std::cout << "Hello World!";
                        return 0;
                    }
            </code>
        </section>

        <section id="Variables" class="main-section">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>You start declaring variables by first defining its type, name and value (the value should correspond to
                its type):</p>
            <code>type name = value;</code>
            <p>Real example:</p>
            <code>string word = "avocado";</code>
        </section>

        <section id="Primitive_Data_Types" class="main-section">
            <header>Primitive Data Types</header>
            <p>All variables use data-type during declaration to restrict the type of data to be stored. Therefore, we
                can say that data types are used to tell the variables the type of data it can store. Whenever a
                variable is defined in C++, the compiler allocates some memory for that variable based on the data type
                with which it is declared. Every data type requires a different amount of memory.</p>
            <p>The main data-types to create variables (primitives) is listed below</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Integer</li>
                <li>Character</li>
                <li>Boolean</li>
                <li>Floating Point</li>
                <li>Double Floating Point</li>
                <li>Valueless or Void</li>
                <li>Wide Character</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="Conditional_Statements" class="main-section">
            <header>Conditional Statements</header>
            <p>In order to make our program do strongs input and outputs we need to learn the if statement.</p>
            <code>if (condition) {
                // block of code if condition is true
              }
              else {
                // block of code if condition is false
              }</code>
        </section>

        <section id="Loops" class="main-section">
            <header>Loops</header>
            <p>Sometimes we need to write a function, let's say, 100 times. With loops, you won't need to write 100
                times, but actually 1 time!</p>
            <p>An example of a loop statement: </p>
            <code>while(condition is true) {
                 // execute this code ... 
                }</code>
